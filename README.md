# Algorithms Done Right !

This Repository consists of a collection of Jupyter (ipython) notebooks, containing implementations of the most commonly used Data-Structures, and the algorithms associated with them.

You can use this as a pocket-book reference to either a CS college exam or for a job interview

Most of the questions answered here came from either well-known interview processes from companies such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Amazon, and from the book "Cracking the code interview"
